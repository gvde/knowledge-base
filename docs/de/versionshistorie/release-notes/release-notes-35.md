# Release Notes 35
<!-- cSpell:disable -->
We are happy to announce the release of i-doit 35. The main focus for this version are quality improvements. A detailed list of over 115 improvements can be found in our [changelog](../changelogs/changelog-35.md).

We also removed the outdated **Download Center** and **Contract details** from the administration, since all their features have been replaced and improved by the [Add-on & Subscription Center](../../administration/add-on-and-subscription-center.md).

Furthermore, we have also extended the compatibility for our Add-on [Forms](../../i-doit-add-ons/forms/index.md) to be used with [i-doit Cloud](<https://www.i-doit.com/produkte/i-doit-cloud>){: target="_blank"} which allows users to also benefit from this Add-on in our Cloud Solution.

## Important note

Due to our internal template engine improvements, we kindly remind you to ensure you are using the latest versions of all installed Add-ons. You can also check if your Add-ons are up-to-date in the internal [Add-on & Subscription Center](../../administration/add-on-and-subscription-center.md) and perform the update if necessary.

We encourage you to [update](../../wartung-und-betrieb/update-einspielen.md) to this release of i-doit and your installed add-ons as soon as possible to benefit from all of these improvements.

If you have further questions about this release, please don't hesitate to contact our support team at <https://help.i-doit.com>{: target="_blank"}.
