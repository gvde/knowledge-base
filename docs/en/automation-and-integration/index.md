# Automation and Integration

Nobody is an island... Especially with the topic of IT documentation/ CMDB you are in the heart of the IT department and of course you want to facilitate your work. So why create users when there is an LDAP interface and why not use the automatic e-mail notification?

The described interfaces are already included in _i-doit_:

*   [E-Mail (SMTP)](./e-mail.md)
*   [i-doit console utility](./cli/index.md)
*   [Network Monitoring](./network-monitoring/index.md)
*   [Trouble Ticket System (TTS)](./service-desk/index.md)
*   [SNMP](./snmp.md)
*   [Task scheduling & Cronjobs](./task-scheduling-and-cronjobs.md)
