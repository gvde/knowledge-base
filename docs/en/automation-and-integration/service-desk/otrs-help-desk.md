# OTRS Help Desk

[OTRS Help Desk](https://www.otrs.com/) is a web application for setting up and operating a service desk. This application and i-doit are able to exchange data via OTRS modules. By this means, OTRS tickets with objects from i-doit can be linked with each other.

OTRS-Modules
------------

Currently there are several OTRS modules and you can find an up-to-date list of them on the i-doit [i-doit website](https://www.i-doit.com/en/i-doit/add-ons/).
