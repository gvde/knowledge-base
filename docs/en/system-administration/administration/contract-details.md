The Contract details was developed to give our customers easy and direct access to the contract details. It is no longer necessary to call up the [customer portal](../customer-portal.md).

## Prerequisite

Please note that an Internet connection and a maximum of one client may be included in the license token to access Contract details page. Otherwise a corresponding error message will be displayed.

## Rights assignment

The **View** right to the **Contract details** can be assigned under **Administration → Permissions → Administration**.

## Usage

The Contract details can be accessed via **Administration → Download Center**. Once there, contract details are listed, like **Contract no**, **Contract end date** and **Status** of the contract.
