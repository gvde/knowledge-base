The Download Center was developed to give our customers easy and direct access to the i-doit updates and add-on packages for the products they have purchased. It is no longer necessary to call up an external website for this.

## Prerequisite

Please note that an Internet connection and a maximum of one client may be included in the license token to access the downloads via the Download Center. Otherwise a corresponding error message will be displayed.

## Rights assignment

The **Execute** right to the **Download Center** can be assigned under **Administration → Permissions → Administration**.

## Usage

The Download Center can be accessed via two routes: **Add-ons → Download Center** and **Administration → Download Center**. Once there, the available downloads are listed, ready to be downloaded via the Download button. The ZIP files are then installed using the usual process via the [Admin Center](../admin-center.md).
