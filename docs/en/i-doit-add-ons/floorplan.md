Via the **Floorplan** [add-on](./index.md) it is possible for you to assign graphical plans to all [objects](../basics/structure-of-the-it-documentation.md) which are location objects, to match them with measurements and to position the locally assigned objects in this plan.

[![Floorplan](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/1-fp.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/1-fp.png)

This add-on is [installed via the admin center](./index.md). Afterwards you will find it at **Add-ons → Floorplan**.

[![Access](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/2-fp.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/2-fp.png)

## Rights assignment

Under **Administration → User permissions → Floorplan**, rights for persons and groups of persons can be adjusted.

## Create a Floorplan

[![formats](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/4-fp.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/4-fp.png)

To create a room plan, click on the **Plus** symbol next to the respective location object in the location view and then save the floorplan. After click on **Edit** the **Change background image** button can be used to place graphics such as the floorplan of a room in the background of the floorplan. A Layout can be created and saved using the **Layout-Editor**. A scale can be added to this graphic using the **Set scale** button. The dimensioning of the room helps with the subsequent positioning of objects so that they can be displayed to scale according to their defined form factor. The following graphic formats are supported for the floorplan: `bmp`, `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `gif`. The maximum file size is limited to **5 MB**. It is also possible to create different **layers** and show or hide them.

## Assign and Place Objects

The location list can be used to display all spatially assigned objects:

[![Assign Objects](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/9-fp.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/9-fp.png)

All objects can be placed on the room plan using the green **Plus** symbol, which is displayed as soon as the mouse is moved over the row. It is possible to place all assigned objects directly by clicking on the corresponding button in the room row.

Once the objects are on the plan, you can select them by clicking on them and then move them. Don't forget to click on **Edit** first.

## Adjust and Form Objects on the Floorplan

In the left area you will find the option to further adjust and form objects. As soon as an object is selected it can be edited:

[![Change position](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/15-fp.svg)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/15-fp.svg) **Choose / create objectform**: The form of the object can be adjusted as desired. Custom forms can be saved.

[![Center](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/16-fp.svg)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/16-fp.svg) **Center on object**: The selected object is centered in the middle of the screen.

[![Rotate](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/17-fp.svg)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/17-fp.svg) **Rotate**: The object can be rotated in any desired way.

[![Unposition object](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/18-fp.svg)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/18-fp.svg) **Unposition object**: The object disappears from the floorplan but can be added again using the object list.

[![radius](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/19-fp.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/19-fp.png) This button opens a pop-up where you can define the object radius. The radius can be colored, displayed transparently and configured in various units of measurement.

[![Form factor](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/20-fp.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/20-fp.png) The objects data from the **Form factor** [category](../basics/structure-of-the-it-documentation.md) are applied via this button. The object will be scaled and displayed accordingly to the set scale of the floorplan.

[![selection list](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/21-fp.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/21-fp.png) Certain object types can be shown or hidden within the floorplan using this selection list in the lower area.

[![The selected](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/22-fp.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/22-fp.png) The selected object within the floorplan will be opened in a new tab inside the browser when you click this button.

When the object is selected in edit mode, it is highlighted with a flashing outline and further options for changing the shape and free rotation are available. The labeling can also be rotated.

## Merging multiple Floorplan

It should be possible to add a floorplan to a floorplan - let's think of a floor that contains several rooms. In this "floor" floorplan we want to position the "room" floorplan.
We need to set some basic rules here - for example, we show only three levels of floorplan, that is:

```text
Base floorplan:
-   obj A
-   obj B
-   floorplan A:
    -   obj C
    -   obj D
-   floorplan B:
    -   obj E
    -   obj F
    -   floorplan C (display as a empty block without its positioned objects)
        -   obj G
        -   obj H
```

Let us imagine we are currently viewing "main floorplan". We should be able to see the nested "floorplan A" and inside of that we should be able to see "floorplan B" (including "obj E" and "obj F"). But "floorplan C" will not be displayed as floorplan - instead it will look like a basic object, because we limit the nested floorplan to three levels (to prevent recursion, memory and performance issues).

### How it works

If you are viewing "main floorplan" you can move "floorplan A" and "floorplan B" like the other objects ("obj A" and "obj B") - you can not edit anything inside this imported

### When can a nested floorplan be displayed?

In order to display "floorplan A" as floorplan inside "main floorplan" it has to fulfill one of these conditions:

-   Have a background image
-   Have a layout

If one of these conditions is met, you will see the following icon, when editing a floorplan object (inside another floorplan): [![icon](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/add-on-icon.svg)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/add-on-icon.svg)

The floorplan should be scaled to the previous object size, the layout / background image will be used to determine the scale.

## Floorplan Profiles

[![Floorplan Profiles](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/24-fp.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/24-fp.png)

Profiles can be created so that only certain objects or attributes of the objects are displayed. A profile is supplied with the program. Of course, you can also create your own profiles.

[![profiles](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/25-fp.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/25-fp.png)

To create a new profile, click on the **Create a new profile** button. It is also possible to duplicate a profile.
After clicking on **Create new profile** we get to the editing view. Here we first assign the name of the profile. Then we can choose whether **Open object view when clicking on object** should be activated and whether **Double-click on object to open in new tab** should be activated.

### Visualization options

[![Highlight color](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/27-fp.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/27-fp.png)

**Highlight color**: Here you can click to select a color that outlines the object when it is clicked.

**Show object radius**: This defines whether the object radius is displayed by default.

### Default values

[![filter](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/29-fp.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/29-fp.png)

## Object Information

[![attributes](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/30-fp.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/30-fp.png)

This object information is then displayed in the object view under object information.

[![object information](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/31-fp.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/31-fp.png)

### Settings

Under Settings, you can define the profile globally or for specific users as the default.

[![defaults](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/32-fp.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/32-fp.png)

## Export

A Floorplan can be exported as SVG or PNG file using the [![Export](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/33-fp.svg)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/floorplan/33-fp.svg) button.
