# Use Forms

## Opening the add-on

After all preparations are completed, the add-on can be accessed via **Add-ons â†’ Forms**.

## Create forms

A form is created via the **Create forms** button. The process begins with the assignment of the form title. Then an object type is selected that is created by the form respectively by the user's input. Now we can add elements to be displayed in the form. Possible elements are **attributes**, **headlines**, **texts** and **dividing lines**.

The order of the elements can be changed afterwards, via **drag&drop**.

Elements that have already been created can be **deleted** or **duplicated**. Of course, you can also distribute the form over several **Pages**. The pages can be moved and deleted in the same way as the other elements.

### **Attribute**

If such an element is added, the attribute selection opens directly. Here, all categories are displayed that are assigned to the object type in i-doit.

The **Field name** can be changed for the element. In addition, a **Pre-defined value** can be stored, this value is then pre-filled.

The **Hide element for recipients** setting is used to hide fields for users. This allows the form to include values **Pre-defined values** defined by the creator in the object to be created.

If the setting is activated, this is visualized by a crossed-out **eye**. In addition, these elements can be marked as _Mark as required Field can not be blank_. These attribute elements must then not be blank. This is indicated by the lettering **Required**.

## Preview

Before you release the form to the user, you naturally want to take a look at it. This is exactly why we have built in the **Preview**! Click the **Preview** button to open it.
