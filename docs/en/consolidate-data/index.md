# Consolidate Data

!!! warning "Please create a complete backup before making any changes to an interface/import. If the result is not satisfying, it can then be restored"

When you break down the [IT documentation](../glossary.md), you always end up with data. Different data in various forms (usually as text) are collected somewhere in order to be organized in i-doit and to be stored in a structured way. Data can also be reused somewhere else in another context. The following articles address the question of where "somewhere" is. To put it briefly: Where do these data come from and where are they needed?

-   [CSV Data Import](csv-data-import/index.md)
-   [CSV Data Export](csv-data-export.md)
-   [h-inventory](h-inventory.md)
-   [JDisc Discovery](jdisc/index.md)
