*[Attribute]: An attribute is a documented value to an object. Attributes of the same kind are summarized in categories. Example: in the "General" category the CMDB status.
*[Category]: Thematically coherent attributes are summed up per object in categories. Three types of categories exist: global, specific and custom. They are also subdivided into single- and multi-value categories. Some categories are backwars while others serve as view. Last but not least special categories like "General" and the "Overview" exist.
*[Object]: In i-doit objects are all things which we document in an IT-documentation, no matter whether they are physical devices like server and clients, or logical constructs like networks and services. An object is defined by its object type, which determines what attributes can be filled with values for the object. In ITIL© the term "Configuration Item" (CI) is used. In the asset management the term "Asset Value" is widely spread. We want to establish a more abstract and therefore a more generally useful definition with the term "Object".
